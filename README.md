# What is the Open Source Branding Project?
Open source software has proven itself to be as good and often better than close sourced software. **BUT!** They severely lack in the visual presentation. In open source, this aestic aesthetic is often held as a badge of virtue. Open source projects are too smart and important to deal with stupid cretinous garbage like pretty buttons and logos!

**This isn't true** In fact, open source projects need good branding more than close sourced projects. 
1. Close sourced products have million dollar ad campaigns and retailers presenting users with solutions all the time.
2. Close sourced software used for development purposes need to only be known by the devs working for the company who owns the source while open source software needs a wide swathe of people contributing, using, and testing code.  

## The Goals

The goals if this project is to provide a place for open source projects to seek help from designers, and to model a solution towards design work which is more native to the open source methodology. This means:

1. Treating design work like code in a repo
2. Utilizing open source and transparent project management solutions like git source control, wiki documentation, and github issue tracking. 
3. Standardarizing the design creation process in such a way that it can be forked or tweaked by other organizations to their own needs. 
4. Allowing for a decentralized collaborative multi-designer fork and merge process. 

This is a hybrid repo, work in progress where I plan to keep information and production files for open source projects that have expressed interest in getting help with visual design and branding. If you want help:

## How is a Branding Package different than a logo?

A branding package is a more all encompassing concept than a logo. A logo can be the starting place for a Branding Package, but a Branding Package extends beyond merely a specific artifact to a documentation and set of guidelins on how a brand is presented. It can be as simple as outlining what fonts are used and in what context, branding colors and their semantics, multiple renders of a logo for different use cases, the "voice" or style of writing, and the concept can even extend into UX where a Design System is essentially the stylistic guidelines of a Brand extended into code and funtionality through animation, UI, and information structure. 

## Outline of what a Branding package entails:
 To start my baseline package is going to be:
1. Type and Font Palette
2. Brand-mark, B/W and W/B
3. Monochrome Logo, B/W and W/B
4. Full color logo render
5. Mood board presentation for general brand aesethetic guidelines. 

Other possible things based on the context of the project can be icons, icon families, Design System Libraries or examples.
