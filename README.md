# What is the Open Source Branding Project?
Open source projects have proven themselves to be as good and often better than close sourced code solutions. But they severely lack in the visual presentation. In open source, this aestic aesthetic is often held as a badge of virtue. Open source projects are too smart and important to deal with stupid cretinous garbage like pretty buttons and logos!

Well I disagree. If anything, open source projects need good branding more than close sourced projects. Close sourced projects have million dollar ad campaigns and retailers presenting users with solutions all the time. And close sourced projects don't need to be well known because the only developers who need to know about it are the ones who work on. Open source however needs good branding, not just to stand out to users but also to be visible to developers!

This is a hybrid repo, work in progress where I plan to keep information and production files for open source projects that have expressed positive interest in my help. If you're interested in having your project get some branding, please log an issue. All this work will be for free of course, I'm not looking for clients through this. I just want to give back, and I'm not yet a good enough coder to do that so I might as well lend a hand to the stuff that I find easy and fun!

## How is a Branding Package different than a logo?

A branding package is a more all encompassing concept than a logo. A logo can be the starting place for a Branding Package, but a Branding Package extends beyond merely a specific artifact to a documentation and set of guidelins on how a brand is presented. It can be as simple as outlining what fonts are used and in what context, branding colors and their semantics, multiple renders of a logo for different use cases, the "voice" or style of writing, and the concept can even extend into UX where a Design System is essentially the stylistic guidelines of a Brand extended into code and funtionality through animation, UI, and information structure. 

## Outline of what a Branding package entails:
 To start my baseline package is going to be:
1. Type and Font Palette
2. Brand-mark, B/W and W/B
3. Monochrome Logo, B/W and W/B
4. Full color logo render
5. Mood board presentation for general brand aesethetic guidelines. 

Other possible things based on the context of the project can be icons, icon families, Design System Libraries or examples.
