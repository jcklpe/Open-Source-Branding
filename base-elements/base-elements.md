# What are base elements?

Base elements are generalizable visual elements which appear throughout a brand without being limited to single self contained components. Examples of base elements would be illustration/photography guidelines, type palette, color palette, and geometry palette. The following is a markdown template for documenting your base element guidelines

## Type Palette

A type palette is a hierarchy of typographic weights/styles used by your brand to structure information. Replace the palette element descriptions with the names/links to your chosen font. A good resource for free fonts is [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/), or [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/)

### Header/Display: 

A font used for headlines. Should be bold and easily scannable. Often your header/display font will be similar to your logo's font if it has one. Examples are [Color Tube](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/colortube?filter%5Bclassifications%5D%5B0%5D=sans+serif&filter%5Bsettings%5D%5B0%5D=show_more_tags), [Baloo](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/baloo?filter%5Bclassifications%5D%5B0%5D=sans+serif&filter%5Bsettings%5D%5B0%5D=show_more_tags) or [Bebas Kai](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas-kai?filter%5Bclassifications%5D%5B0%5D=sans+serif&filter%5Bsettings%5D%5B0%5D=show_more_tags).

### Paragraph:

This is the font you'll use for prose body copy. So it's the workhorse of the brand type palette and should be fairly unobtrusive and read clearly with lots of text blocks. Examples are [Quicksand](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/quicksand?filter%5Bclassifications%5D%5B0%5D=sans+serif&filter%5Btags%5D%5B0%5D=contemporary&filter%5Btags%5D%5B1%5D=paragraph),[BonvenoCF](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/BonvenoCF?filter%5Bclassifications%5D%5B0%5D=sans+serif&filter%5Btags%5D%5B0%5D=paragraph), or [Open Sans](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans?q%5Bterm%5D=open+sans&q%5Bsearch_check%5D=Y). 

### Monospace

If you're here, you're probably building a brand in the context of an open source branding project, which means code, and code is best displayed with monospace fonts. A good resource for this is the [Nerd Font Project](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). Examples are [Fira Code](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode), [Input](https://input.fontbureau.com/), or [Space Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/SpaceMono).
