about: Request for visual design and branding

## What is this?
Hey, are you an open source project looking to add to your visual design and branding? Just file an issue here! 

## Things to include:

1. Name of your org or project
1.1 Is this name permanent or are you open to name rebrands?
2. Do you have any existing visual design assets for the project such as:
2.1 Preferred typography family. 
2.2 Brand colors
2.3 An existing logo
3. What is your target audience or user?


Filing an issue for branding request is no guarantee that I'll do the branding but there's a good chance I will so please do it! The purpose of doing things this way is to try to model a possible approach to visual design and branding which fits the open source world, uses it's tools, and is replicated, forked, and scaled in ways that traditional visual design has not been before.
