Your illustration library is a repository of pre-made illustrations that can be used to build your brand identity. Some good articles on the subject:

[The Power of Illustration in Brand Story and Identity](https://blog.lingoapp.com/the-power-of-illustration-in-brand-story-and-identity-d6adb8aa766)

and here is a good resource for finding free illustrations:

Illustration is more finicky than graphic design proper. The free resources available are harder to integrate into a brand identity than flat abstract tech-centric icons.
